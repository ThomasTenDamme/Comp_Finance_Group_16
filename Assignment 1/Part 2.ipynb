    "# Binomial Tree: option valuation (50 pts.)\n",
    " \n",
    " A commonly used approach to compute the price of an option is the so-called binomial tree method. Suppose that the maturity of an option on a non-dividend-paying stock St is divided into N subintervals of length ∆t. We will refer to the j th node at time i · ∆t as the (i, j) node. The stock price at the (i, j) node is Si,j = S0u^j * d^(i-j) (with u and d the upward and downward stock price movements, respectively). In the binomial tree approach, option prices are computed through a backward induction scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The value of a call option at its expiration date is max{$0, S_{N,j} − K$};\n",
    "2. Suppose that the values of the option at time (i + 1) · ∆t is known for all j. There is a risk-neutral probability p of moving from the (i, j) node at time i · ∆t to the (i + 1, j + 1) node at time (i + 1) · ∆t , and a probability 1 − p of moving from the (i, j) node at time i · ∆t to the (i + 1, j) node at time (i + 1) · ∆t . Risk-neutral valuation gives $f_{i,j} = e^{-r\\Delta t} \\left( p f_{i+1,j+1} + (1 - p) f_{i+1,j} \\right)$\n",

    "A general introduction to the binomial tree model and a detailed derivation of the relevant parameters is provided in appendix A. Please read the appendix carefully before starting on the assignment.\n",

    "Consider a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock with a maturity of one year and strike price of €99. Let the one year interest rate be 6% and the current price of the stock be €100. Furthermore, assume that the volatility is 20%."
